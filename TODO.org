* DONE Try to see what happens with QSS2-QSS1 delta-step size or quanta-quanta/2 delta step size difference for checking error on time-scale.
  SCHEDULED: <2018-03-30 Fri> DEADLINE: <2018-03-30 Fri>
* DONE Check how to handle x'(t) = x(t) + y(t) type ODEs, especially since they all need different quanta, so which quanta to take?
  SCHEDULED: <2018-03-30 Fri> DEADLINE: <2018-03-30 Fri>
* DONE Check the problem with x' = 1, etc.
* DONE Check what to do with imaginary roots and also negative roots.
