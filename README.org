* An event based framework for simulating network of hybrid automata.
  The main contribution is the integration technique, especially
  combination of higher order Quantized state systems combined with
  higher order Taylor series.
  
* Python dependencies
** Simpy
** Sympy
** Numpy
* To Run do the following:
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  # Installing the required dependencies
  pip install simpy sympy numpy
  # running an example
  cd eha/examples
  export PYTHONPATH=../
  ./robot.py			# Running the robot example

#+END_SRC
